# Project-1: Scroll Animation

A simple project to animate the show and hide features of some HTML elements on page scroll.

The highlights here are -

- In CSS, how to use the translateX property to hide the elements initially by moving it outside the view, and then bringing it back to view. And use transition for smooth animation.
- In JS, how to first retrieve the window bottom values, and then check if the top of the element falls within that window bottom value then show it, if not then hide it.
